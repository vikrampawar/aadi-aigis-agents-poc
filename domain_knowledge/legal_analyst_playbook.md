# Legal Risk & Due Diligence for Upstream Oil & Gas Assets  
### First‑Principles Framework and Rules of Thumb for an AI Agent

This document gives an **upstream‑focused legal due diligence** framework for an AI assistant reviewing oil and gas asset acquisitions.  
It covers licences/PSCs, SPAs (warranties and indemnities), liens and litigation, operator risk for non‑op interests, and common red flags.[web:38][web:42][web:32][web:41][web:48][web:51]

The agent must:

- Treat this as **generic guidance**, not jurisdiction‑specific legal advice.
- Anchor conclusions in traceable documents (licenses, PSCs, JOAs, SPAs, litigation registers) and flag any interpretation as such.[web:38][web:42][web:32][web:48]

## 1. Validity of Licences / PSCs and Expiry Risk

### 1.1 Core Concepts

In many upstream regimes:

- **Title to petroleum** remains with the state; companies hold contractual rights via licences, concessions or PSCs.[web:38][web:42]
- The economic value of an acquisition depends on:
  - Validity and enforceability of these instruments.
  - Remaining **term** (exploration, development, production phases).
  - Compliance with work and expenditure obligations.[web:38][web:42][web:51]

Buyer‑oriented guidance emphasises:

- Verifying PSCs and key contracts are **“in full force and effect,”** with no uncured defaults.[web:38][web:43]
- Assessing how much reserves can be produced within the remaining term to ensure sufficient economic return.[web:38][web:42]

### 1.2 Agent Checklist for Licences / PSCs

For each licence/PSC:

- Confirm **existence and chain of title**:
  - Original grant instrument, subsequent renewals, extensions, farm‑ins/farm‑outs, and assignments.
- Check **term and expiry**:
  - Current phase (exploration, appraisal, development/production).
  - Expiry dates, renewal rights, and any long‑stop dates for development/production.[web:38][web:42]
- Confirm **work / expenditure obligations**:
  - Past obligations met (seismic, wells, minimum spend, relinquishment).
  - Current/future obligations and any risk of default or forfeiture.[web:38][web:42][web:51]
- Verify **change‑of‑control / assignment consent**:
  - Many PSCs/JOAs require host government consent and waiver of pre‑emption rights for transfers.[web:38][web:43]
  - Identify conditions precedent in the SPA linked to such consents.

Rules of thumb for the agent:

- Treat licences/PSCs close to expiry with limited remaining reserves as **high‑risk** unless clear extension/renewal rights exist and are likely to be exercised.[web:38][web:42]
- Flag any evidence of non‑compliance (unmet work obligations, unpaid fees, regulatory notices) as potentially value‑eroding and a risk to title.[web:38][web:43][web:32]

## 2. SPA Indemnity Coverage and Risk Allocation

### 2.1 Indemnities vs Warranties

In typical M&A practice:

- **Warranties** are contractual statements of fact about the target; breach gives rise to damages subject to caps, baskets, limitation periods, etc.[web:49][web:42]
- **Indemnities** are promises to compensate for specific losses; they are often:
  - Dollar‑for‑dollar.
  - Focused on known risks (e.g. tax, environmental, litigation, title issues).[web:52][web:46][web:49]

In oil and gas transactions:

- **Specific indemnities** are commonly used where due diligence has identified particular issues not fully priced into the purchase price.[web:46][web:52]
- Title to oil and gas interests is often conveyed with a **special warranty of title** (limiting the seller’s liability to periods during which it owned the interests), but practice varies by jurisdiction.[web:46]

### 2.2 Agent Checklist for Indemnity Coverage

When reviewing a draft SPA:

- Identify the **scope of indemnities**:
  - General indemnities (if any) vs specific indemnities for known issues (e.g. identified tax exposures, environmental contamination, litigation, decom liabilities).[web:46][web:52]
- Review **caps and limitations**:
  - Are specific indemnities capped at estimated exposure or at the overall purchase price?
  - Are they carved out from general caps, baskets or de minimis thresholds?[web:52][web:49]
- Check **duration**:
  - Survival periods for tax, environmental, title and other key indemnities.
- Confirm **security / credit support**:
  - Escrows, holdbacks, parent guarantees, or reps and warranties insurance (RWI) backing the indemnity.[web:46][web:52]

Rules of thumb:

- Specific indemnities for identified issues should **match the risk magnitude** and ideally not be constrained by general basket/de minimis thresholds.[web:52]
- RWI can shift some indemnification risk from seller to insurer, but the agent should:
  - Verify coverage limits, exclusions and retention.
  - Note that RWI typically sits on top of a negotiated warranty/indemnity package, not in place of due diligence.[web:46]

## 3. Liens, Litigation and Other Encumbrances

### 3.1 Vendor Liens and Security Interests

Key issues:

- Existing lenders or service providers may hold:
  - Security interests, mortgages or fixed/floating charges over licences, PSC interests, infrastructure or receivables.
  - Vendor or mechanic’s liens in some jurisdictions for unpaid services or materials.[web:42][web:32][web:48]

The agent should:

- Identify all **security documents** and registrations:
  - Local charge registries, UCC filings (for US), company charges registers.
- Confirm the SPA provides for:
  - Release of existing security at or prior to completion.
  - Evidence of discharge, payoff letters and related mechanics.

If liens remain post‑closing, they may:

- Restrict further financing capacity.
- Allow third parties to enforce security against the acquired interests.

### 3.2 Litigation, Investigations and Regulatory Sanctions

Due diligence guidance stresses the need to:

- Verify that the seller/target has obtained and maintained all governmental permits and licences and complied with applicable laws.[web:38][web:43][web:32]
- Identify all:
  - Ongoing litigation.
  - Threatened or potential claims.
  - Regulatory investigations or sanctions (safety, environmental, anti‑corruption, labour).[web:38][web:32][web:48]

The agent should:

- Review:
  - Litigation registers, legal opinions, regulatory correspondence, and board/minute records where available.
- Assess:
  - Potential financial exposure.
  - Whether specific indemnities or purchase price adjustments are included to cover material disputes.[web:38][web:43][web:52]

Rules of thumb:

- Repeated or systemic regulatory non‑compliance (e.g. HSE violations, local content breaches) is a red flag for both **legal and operational risk** and may affect licence security.[web:38][web:32]
- Pending high‑value disputes or investigations should be:
  - Quantified where possible.
  - Addressed through specific indemnities or closing adjustments.

## 4. Asset Quality and Operator Reputation (for Non‑Op Interests)

### 4.1 Non‑Operated Interests and Joint Operating Agreements (JOAs)

Non‑operated (non‑op) interests are typically governed by a **JOA**, which:

- Regulates the relationship between operator and non‑operators.
- Allocates rights and obligations, including:
  - Management of operations.
  - Cost‑sharing and cash calls.
  - Voting rights and decision‑making.
  - Liability limitations and operator standard of care.[web:45][web:47][web:50]

Key points from JOA literature:

- JOAs traditionally favour the operator, especially regarding control over operations and limits on operator liability.[web:45][web:47]
- Non‑operators are:
  - Obliged to pay their share of costs via cash calls.
  - Jointly liable with the operator to third parties, even though they do not control day‑to‑day operations.[web:47][web:50]

### 4.2 Assessing Operator Quality and Reputation

For non‑op acquisitions, the **quality of the operator** is critical:

- The operator’s technical competence, HSSE culture and project management directly influence:
  - Safety and environmental performance.
  - Cost efficiency and schedule.
  - Ability to secure and maintain licences.[web:45][web:47]
- Empirical work on JVP risks highlights:
  - Organisational fit, project management competence, worker skill levels and productivity as significant risk factors.[web:45]

Agent checklist:

- Review:
  - Operator’s track record in the basin/region (cost overruns, schedule slippage, HSSE incidents).
  - Regulatory standing and relationship with host authorities.
  - Credit quality and financial resilience.
- Examine JOA terms:
  - Voting thresholds and reserved matters.
  - Operator standard of care (e.g. “reasonable and prudent operator”).
  - Removal and replacement mechanisms for the operator.
  - Audit rights and information rights for non‑operators.[web:45][web:47][web:50]

Rules of thumb:

- A non‑op stake with a strong, reputable operator and balanced JOA terms can be attractive despite limited control.
- A non‑op stake with:
  - Weak operator,
  - Poor reporting and audit rights,
  - Limited ability to influence budgets and work programmes,
  should be treated as **higher‑risk** and may warrant pricing or structural protection.

## 5. Warranties and Indemnities Proposed by the Seller

### 5.1 Typical Warranty Packages in Upstream Deals

Typical upstream SPA warranty packages cover:

- Corporate and authority: capacity, authorisations, solvency.
- Title and ownership: valid title to the interests being sold, no undisclosed encumbrances.
- Licences/PSCs: in full force and effect, compliance with material obligations, no notices of default.[web:38][web:42]
- JOAs and key contracts: validity, no defaults, no undisclosed termination rights.[web:38][web:32][web:41]
- Financial, tax and employment matters.
- Litigation, environmental and regulatory compliance.[web:38][web:32][web:42]

Practice commentary notes:

- In UK‑style SPAs, warranties are typically subject to:
  - Caps, baskets, de minimis thresholds and time limitations.
  - Disclosure against a data room or disclosure letter.[web:49][web:52]
- Indemnities are often limited to specific known issues rather than being a general form of warranty recovery.[web:49][web:52]
- In some US‑style deals, buyers may be indemnified for breaches of warranties on a more direct dollar‑for‑dollar basis, but this is highly jurisdiction‑ and deal‑specific.[web:49]

### 5.2 Agent Checklist on Warranties and Indemnities

The agent should:

- Catalogue all **warranties**, grouped by topic (title, licences, contracts, tax, environment, litigation, decom).
- Map **disclosures**:
  - Identify which warranties are qualified by disclosures (data room, disclosure letter).
  - Recognise that known issues may be carved out of warranty coverage and instead handled via specific indemnities or pricing.[web:49][web:52]
- Analyse **limitations of liability**:
  - Caps as percentage of purchase price.
  - Baskets and de minimis limits.
  - Survival periods by warranty category (e.g. tax vs general business warranties).[web:49][web:52]
- Review interactions with **RWI** (if present):
  - RWI may extend effective coverage beyond the SPA cap, but usually with exclusions and retention.[web:46]

Rules of thumb:

- For material upstream risks (title, licences, environmental, decom), short survival periods or very low caps may be a red flag, especially where issues are hard to detect pre‑closing.
- Specific indemnities should be used where due diligence has identified concrete, quantifiable risks (e.g. specific tax assessments, identified environmental contamination, particular litigation matters).[web:46][web:52]

## 6. Other Typical Red Flags and Focus Areas

### 6.1 Change of Control, Pre‑Emption and Consents

Common issues in PSCs, JOAs and licences:

- Change‑of‑control restrictions requiring:
  - Host government consent.
  - Waiver of pre‑emption or rights of first offer by existing JV partners.[web:38][web:43]
- Failure to secure such consents/waivers typically leads to:
  - Closing conditions not being satisfied.
  - Potential re‑allocation of interests or deal renegotiation.

The agent should:

- Identify all consents and waivers needed for closing and confirm they are:
  - Conditions precedent in the SPA.
  - Supported by a realistic plan and timetable.[web:38][web:43][web:51]

### 6.2 Environmental and Decommissioning Liabilities

Legal and financial guidance emphasises:

- Environmental and decom obligations can be large and persistent, and liability may extend to prior owners under some regimes.[web:23][web:38][web:42]
- Decommissioning security agreements (DSAs) and similar arrangements allocate and secure decom obligations between co‑venturers and buyers/sellers.[web:20][web:17]

Agent tasks:

- Review:
  - Environmental permits, impact assessments, compliance history, and any notices of violation.
  - Decommissioning programmes, DSAs and related security arrangements (letters of credit, parent guarantees).[web:38][web:23][web:17][web:20]
- Assess:
  - Whether decom liabilities are fully transferred and adequately secured.
  - Whether seller retains any joint or alternative liability and how this is addressed in the SPA.

### 6.3 Contractual and Operational Risks

Checklists for oil and gas deals highlight the need to review:[web:32][web:41][web:48][web:51]

- Material commercial contracts:
  - Drilling, service, FPSO/FSO, pipeline, processing, marketing/offtake.
  - Termination rights, penalties, and change‑of‑control clauses.
- Local content and community obligations:
  - Non‑compliance can carry legal and reputational risks and jeopardise licences.[web:38]
- Anti‑corruption and sanctions compliance:
  - Investigations or history of violations can result in significant penalties and licence risk.[web:38][web:32][web:48]

### 6.4 Practical Red‑Flag Heuristics for the Agent

The agent should treat the following as **high‑priority red flags**:

- Licences/PSCs not demonstrably in full force and effect; evidence of notices of default or threatened termination.[web:38][web:43]
- Significant outstanding litigation or regulatory investigations without clear quantification or risk mitigation.[web:38][web:32]
- Material security interests or liens that are not clearly being released at closing.
- Weak warranty/indemnity packages:
  - Very low caps, short survival periods for key risk areas, no meaningful specific indemnities despite known issues.[web:49][web:52]
- Non‑op interests with:
  - Poor operator track record.
  - JOA terms heavily skewed to operator with limited non‑op rights and high joint liability.[web:45][web:47][web:50]
- Environmental and decom obligations:
  - Large exposures with inadequate security, unclear allocation or ambiguous post‑closing responsibility.[web:23][web:20][web:17]

## 7. How the AI Agent Should Use This Playbook

When answering questions or performing analysis, the agent should:

1. Map the query to the relevant sections: licences/PSCs, SPA indemnities, liens/litigation, non‑op/operator risk, warranties, and red‑flag screening.
2. Extract and cross‑reference **primary documents**:
   - Licences/PSCs, JOAs, SPAs, DSAs, contract lists, litigation registers, regulatory correspondence.[web:38][web:42][web:32][web:48]
3. Build a structured **risk matrix**:
   - For each risk, record: description, evidence, likelihood, financial impact, mitigations (warranties/indemnities/security) and residual risk.
4. Clearly distinguish:
   - Confirmed facts from documents.
   - Reasoned interpretations and judgement calls, with confidence levels.
5. Highlight:
   - Specific red flags and missing information.
   - Areas requiring specialist legal input or further documentation before proceeding.

This playbook is contextual guidance only; users must rely on qualified legal counsel and primary documents for transaction decisions.[web:38][web:42][web:32][web:48]
