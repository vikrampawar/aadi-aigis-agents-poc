# ESG Risk Evaluation for Upstream Oil & Gas Assets  
### First‑Principles Framework and Rules of Thumb for an AI Agent

This document provides an **ESG‑focused** framework for assessing upstream oil and gas assets in M&A and financing contexts.  
It covers jurisdictional ESG policy, asset‑level carbon intensity and mitigations, carbon pricing in financial models, impacts on licence to operate, and other ESG issues that can affect value and deliverability.[web:53][web:57][web:66][web:63]

The agent must:

- Treat this as **generic guidance**, not jurisdiction‑specific legal or policy advice.
- Anchor conclusions in traceable documents and data (policies, company ESG reports, emissions data, contracts), and clearly flag interpretations.[web:53][web:57][web:58][web:66]

---

## 1. Jurisdictional ESG Requirements and Policy Direction

### 1.1 Why Jurisdiction Matters

ESG risk for upstream assets is heavily shaped by **local regulation and policy trajectory**:

- Climate policies (e.g. national net‑zero commitments, NDCs, carbon pricing, methane rules).
- Environmental regulation (flaring limits, venting and methane controls, produced water discharge standards).
- Social and governance expectations (local content, human rights, transparency, anti‑corruption).[web:53][web:57][web:66]

ESG due diligence providers stress that understanding the **regulatory direction of travel** is critical to avoid importing future compliance and transition risk into portfolios.[web:53][web:57][web:66]

### 1.2 Agent Checklist – Jurisdictional ESG Landscape

For each asset jurisdiction, the agent should:

- Identify relevant **climate and ESG frameworks**:
  - National net‑zero targets and interim goals.
  - Sector‑specific decarbonisation strategies for oil and gas (e.g. methane action plans, flaring phase‑out).[web:66][web:64]
- Map **current and emerging regulations** affecting upstream:
  - GHG reporting and disclosure (e.g. TCFD‑style requirements, EU CSRD‑type rules where applicable).[web:57][web:66][web:63]
  - Emissions performance standards (flaring limits, methane intensity thresholds).
  - Carbon pricing mechanisms (carbon taxes, ETS, offset rules).[web:66]
- Assess **investor and lender expectations**:
  - Sustainable finance criteria and ESG KPIs attached to lending (interest rate ratchets based on carbon intensity or ESG KPIs).[web:57][web:66]
  - Stewardship expectations (e.g. PRI, TCFD, SFDR, voluntary ESG frameworks).[web:55][web:63][web:66]

Rules of thumb:

- Tightening policy (e.g. stricter GHG disclosure, methane limits, or carbon pricing) increases **transition risk** and potential future cost for high‑emitting assets.[web:57][web:66]
- The agent should flag jurisdictions where:
  - Upcoming regulations (e.g. mandatory climate reporting, stronger methane rules) may materially increase compliance costs or cap production.[web:57][web:66][web:63]

## 2. Carbon Intensity and Operator Mitigations

### 2.1 Understanding Upstream Carbon Intensity

Upstream **carbon intensity** is typically expressed as kg CO₂e per barrel of oil equivalent produced.  
Key drivers are:

- Flaring and venting of associated gas.
- Methane leaks and fugitives.
- Energy use for production (power generation, compression, pumping).
- Logistics and supply chain emissions.[web:66][web:61][web:58][web:67]

Examples from industry data:

- The Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) set a collective target to reduce member companies’ aggregate upstream carbon intensity from about 23 kg CO₂e/boe in 2017 to 17 kg CO₂e/boe by 2025.[web:67]
- OGCI members have also significantly reduced methane and flaring intensity, achieving methane intensity well below 0.20% and cutting flaring emissions by more than 50% vs 2017.[web:58][web:64]
- Life‑cycle analysis for Delaware Basin crude finds upstream carbon intensity around 19.5 kg CO₂e/bbl when flaring is limited to 1% of produced gas, highlighting the strong impact of flaring and methane on overall intensity.[web:61]

### 2.2 Agent Checklist – Asset‑Level Carbon Intensity

For each asset, the agent should:

- Obtain **quantitative emissions metrics** where available:
  - Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, upstream carbon intensity (kg CO₂e/boe), methane intensity, flaring rates.[web:58][web:61][web:67]
- Disaggregate major sources:
  - Flaring, venting, fugitives, combustion, power generation, logistics.[web:61][web:66]
- Benchmark:
  - Against operator’s portfolio averages and peers.
  - Against industry targets (e.g. OGCI’s carbon and methane intensity ambitions, “zero routine flaring by 2030” initiatives).[web:58][web:64][web:67]

High carbon intensity vs benchmarks indicates higher **ESG and transition risk**, potentially impacting cost of capital and licence to operate.[web:57][web:63][web:66]

### 2.3 Operator Mitigations and Abatement Measures

The agent should identify what **mitigation measures** are already in place or planned, such as:

- Flaring and methane:
  - Gas capture and utilisation projects.
  - Reinjection of associated gas.
  - Leak detection and repair (LDAR) programmes.
  - Commitment to end routine flaring by 2030.[web:58][web:64][web:67][web:66]
- Energy efficiency and electrification:
  - Electrification of platforms or facilities (e.g. grid power, renewables).
  - Waste heat recovery and optimisation of compression and pumping.[web:66][web:54]
- Carbon management:
  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects.
  - Use of carbon offsets/credits for residual emissions, where credible.[web:66][web:62][web:65]

Rules of thumb:

- Assets with robust, evidenced mitigation plans aligned to recognised pathways (e.g. methane, flaring and carbon intensity targets) are more resilient to tightening ESG expectations.[web:57][web:58][web:64][web:67]
- Lack of credible mitigation, especially in high‑intensity assets, should be flagged as a major ESG risk and potential overhang on valuation and financing.[web:57][web:66][web:63]

## 3. Carbon Pricing, Credits and Financial Integration

### 3.1 Carbon Pricing Mechanisms

Carbon‑related costs enter project economics via:

- **Compliance carbon pricing**:
  - Carbon taxes, emissions trading schemes (ETS) and regulated offset mechanisms, where emitters must surrender allowances or pay taxes per tonne CO₂e.[web:66]
- **Voluntary carbon credits**:
  - Purchase and retirement of voluntary offsets to meet corporate net‑zero or carbon‑neutral goals, outside or in addition to compliance schemes.[web:62][web:59][web:65]

ESG due diligence and climate‑risk guidance emphasise the need to **quantify financial impacts** of climate‑related risks, including the cost of compliance and carbon pricing under TCFD‑style scenarios.[web:57][web:66]

### 3.2 Carbon Credits – Quality and Structuring

For carbon credits:

- High‑quality credits must demonstrate:
  - Additionality (beyond business‑as‑usual).
  - Robust monitoring, reporting and verification.
  - Permanence and low risk of reversal.[web:65]
- Carbon credit pre‑purchase structures (e.g. VERPAs) can be used to finance decarbonisation projects but introduce specific **contractual and market risks**, with returns tied to future credit delivery and pricing.[web:59]

Industry commentary notes that pre‑purchasing credits through long‑term offtake agreements involves complex legal, tax and regulatory considerations and is more speculative than traditional project finance.[web:59][web:65]

### 3.3 Integrating Carbon Costs into Financial Analysis

The agent should:

- Identify whether the asset:
  - Is subject to a compliance carbon price now or is likely to be within its economic life (jurisdictional analysis).[web:66]
  - Relies on voluntary offsets to meet corporate ESG targets.[web:62][web:57][web:63]
- Translate carbon pricing into **per‑barrel costs**:
  - Carbon cost per tonne × upstream intensity (tCO₂e/boe) → incremental opex per boe.
  - Incorporate into NFA and management cases and breakeven price calculations.[web:66][web:37]
- Evaluate offset/credit strategies:
  - Volume of credits required vs own emissions.
  - Cost assumptions and durations.
  - Quality and reliability of credit supply.[web:62][web:59][web:65]

Rules of thumb:

- For high‑intensity assets in jurisdictions likely to tighten carbon policies, the agent should:
  - Run sensitivities at higher carbon prices and stricter emissions constraints.
  - Treat valuation based on zero or low carbon costs as optimistic.[web:66][web:57][web:63]
- Carbon credits can mitigate **reported** footprint but do not reduce physical emissions or all transition risks; over‑reliance on low‑quality offsets is an ESG red flag.[web:65][web:63][web:66]

## 4. ESG Policies, Licence to Operate and Production Licences

### 4.1 ESG and Licence to Operate

ESG factors affect the **social and regulatory licence to operate**:

- Stakeholders – regulators, investors, communities and NGOs – increasingly scrutinise:
  - GHG performance (carbon intensity, methane, flaring).
  - Environmental practices (spills, water use, biodiversity).
  - Social performance (local employment, community relations, human rights).
  - Governance (transparency, anti‑corruption, third‑party risk).[web:57][web:66][web:60][web:55]

ESG due diligence advisors note that poor ESG performance can devalue or even scupper deals as ESG‑linked scrutiny grows and climate‑related litigation increases.[web:57][web:66][web:63]

### 4.2 Direct Impacts on Licences and Operating Permissions

ESG‑related non‑compliance can directly or indirectly affect:

- Operating permits and environmental licences (e.g. suspension or revocation after serious incidents).
- Approvals for new developments or expansions (e.g. climate and biodiversity scrutiny for major projects).
- Renewals or extensions of production licences, especially where climate commitments or ESG conditions are now embedded in licensing criteria.[web:66][web:38][web:63]

The agent should:

- Review regulatory correspondence and history of:
  - HSE incidents, spills, environmental violations and fines.
  - Non‑compliance with ESG‑related permit conditions.
- Check whether:
  - Future developments require environmental/ESG approvals that could face elevated climate‑related scrutiny.
  - Host‑government policies tie licence awards/renewals to climate or ESG performance.[web:66][web:38][web:57]

Rules of thumb:

- Repeated or serious ESG violations (especially environmental or human‑rights related) indicate heightened risk to continued operations and project approvals.[web:66][web:63][web:60]
- Assets in regions with strong climate policy and active civil society may face more **permitting and litigation risk** for high‑emission projects.[web:66][web:63]

## 5. Other ESG Issues Affecting Value and Deliverability

### 5.1 Physical Climate Risk

Climate‑risk frameworks emphasise **physical risks** such as:[web:66]

- Acute: storms, flooding, wildfires and heatwaves affecting facilities and logistics.
- Chronic: sea‑level rise, temperature and weather pattern shifts affecting offshore and coastal infrastructure.

The agent should:

- Identify whether assets are located in **high‑risk physical climate zones**.
- Review resilience measures:
  - Design standards, redundancy, storm hardening and business continuity planning.
- Recognise that higher physical risk may:
  - Increase insurance costs.
  - Drive higher outage frequency and capex for resilience.[web:66][web:54]

### 5.2 Social and Human Rights Risks

ESG due diligence tools flag:

- Risks from third‑party relationships and supply chains, including labour standards, human rights and community impacts.[web:55][web:60]
- In upstream contexts, key issues include:
  - Land rights and indigenous/community consent.
  - Local content and employment obligations.
  - Security practices and interactions with public or private security forces.[web:66][web:55]

The agent should review:

- Social impact assessments and stakeholder engagement plans.
- Allegations or findings of human‑rights violations, community disputes or protests.
- Compliance with global standards where relevant (e.g. UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, IFC performance standards, OECD guidelines).[web:55][web:66]

Social controversies can lead to operational disruptions, reputational damage and in some cases regulatory or legal sanctions.[web:66][web:63][web:60]

### 5.3 Governance and Third‑Party Risk

Governance issues include:

- Anti‑corruption and sanctions compliance.
- Board oversight of climate and ESG risks.
- Quality of ESG data and reporting controls.[web:66][web:63][web:60]

Third‑party risk management guidance stresses that weak oversight of suppliers, contractors and intermediaries can create significant ESG and integrity risks.[web:60][web:55]

The agent should:

- Examine:
  - Anti‑bribery/anti‑corruption policies and any enforcement actions.
  - Third‑party due diligence procedures and findings.
  - ESG governance structures and reporting frameworks.[web:60][web:55][web:63]
- Flag:
  - Poor ESG data quality and gaps in reporting.
  - History of corruption cases or sanctions issues involving the operator or key contractors.

### 5.4 Financing Implications

RPS and other advisors highlight that strong ESG performance can:

- Support **lower cost of capital** via sustainable finance instruments and ESG‑linked loans, where interest rate ratchets reward lower carbon intensity and other ESG KPIs.[web:57][web:66]
- Improve access to capital markets as investors integrate climate and ESG into decision‑making.[web:63][web:66]

Conversely, weak ESG performance can:

- Increase financing costs or limit access to funding.
- Lead to divestment pressures and stranded‑asset risk in high‑emission or high‑risk assets.[web:57][web:63][web:66]

The agent should therefore:

- Consider ESG metrics alongside financial and subsurface metrics when assessing asset bankability and valuation.
- Highlight where ESG upgrades (e.g. flaring reduction, methane abatement) could unlock better financing terms or support investment cases.[web:57][web:66]
